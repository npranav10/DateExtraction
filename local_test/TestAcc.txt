After Test Intertion 4:

1) Pytesseract was not able to extract even a single character from 54 of the images and was not able to stream in bytes from 6 of the images
2) Many images are in the format Mar18'18 ,in which the " ' " is not decoded properly. Hence regex doesnot work.
3) 204 images were found not to have a valid date or improper decoding by Pytesseract.
4) Date formats:

mmmdd'yy
mmmdd,yyyy
mm/dd/yy
dd/mm/yy
dd/mm/yyyy
mm/dd/yyyy
dd-mmm-yyyy

5) System was able to correctly extract dates from 330 of the receipts. 

6) Current detection Accuracy: 61.6% which can be improved to 
 (i) 89% (535/595) if a failproof decoding is used.
 (ii) 100% (595/595) if pytesseract package binaries can be trained to detect text in low light sceanrios or is tweaked to fit the current set of images. The former option is preferred.
